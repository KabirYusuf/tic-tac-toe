I'm thrilled to introduce a Tic-Tac-Toe game designed by Yusuf Kabir Adekunle using Java. Crafted during my journey of learning Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), this project served as a pivotal tool in deepening my understanding of OOP concepts.

The game offers an engaging experience, allowing for either two-player mode or gameplay against the computer. It runs seamlessly on the command line interface, providing a simple yet enjoyable gaming experience.

One of the highlights of this project is the incorporation of unit testing, which played a crucial role in ensuring the functionality and reliability of the game. Through rigorous testing, I was able to refine the gameplay and deliver a robust solution.

Overall, this Tic-Tac-Toe game holds a special place in my learning journey, significantly contributing to my growth as a Java developer. It not only honed my skills in OOP but also instilled a sense of accomplishment, reaffirming my passion for software development.
